"""Material propagation functions.

Extended Summary
----------------
Optical field propagation methods based on sliced material models.
This module will implement propagation through volumetric materials
represented as SlicedMaterialFunction PyTrees.

Routine Listings
----------------
(Coming soon)

Notes
-----
This module is under development and will contain propagators for
materials represented as 3D sliced functions, enabling realistic
simulation of light propagation through complex optical media.

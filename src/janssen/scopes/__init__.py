"""Microscope implementations and forward models.

Extended Summary
----------------
Complete forward models for optical microscopy including diffraction
patterns, light-sample interactions, and multi-position imaging.

Submodules
----------
simple_microscopes
    Simple microscope forward models for optical microscopy

Routine Listings
----------------
linear_interaction : function
    Propagates an optical wavefront through a sample using linear interaction
diffractogram_noscale : function
    Calculates the diffractogram without scaling camera pixel size
simple_diffractogram : function
    Calculates the diffractogram using a simple model
simple_microscope : function
    Calculates 3D diffractograms at all pixel positions in parallel

Notes
-----
These functions provide complete forward models for optical microscopy
and are designed for use in inverse problems and ptychography reconstruction.
All functions are JAX-compatible and support automatic differentiation.

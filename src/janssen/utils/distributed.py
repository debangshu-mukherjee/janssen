"""Multi-device utilities for scalable optical computing.

Extended Summary
----------------
Provides utilities for distributed computing with JAX, enabling efficient
parallel processing across multiple devices (CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs). This
module simplifies device mesh creation and array sharding for data parallelism
in optical simulations.

Routine Listings
----------------
create_mesh : function
    Creates a device mesh for data parallelism across available devices.
get_device_count : function
    Gets the number of available JAX devices.
shard_batch : function
    Shards array data across the batch dimension for parallel processing.

Notes
-----
This module is designed for scaling optical simulations across multiple
devices. The batch dimension is sharded by default, making it ideal for
processing multiple optical fields or wavefronts in parallel.

Examples
--------
>>> import jax.numpy as jnp
>>> from janssen.utils.distributed import create_mesh, shard_batch
>>>
>>> # Create a mesh using all available devices
>>> mesh = create_mesh()
>>>
>>> # Shard a batch of data across devices
>>> data = jnp.ones((8, 256, 256))
>>> sharded_data = shard_batch(data, mesh)

    """Create a device mesh for data parallelism.

    Creates a 1D device mesh suitable for sharding arrays across their
    batch dimension. The mesh can be used with sharding specifications
    to distribute computation across multiple devices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_devices : int, optional
        Number of devices to use in the mesh. If None, uses all available
        devices detected by JAX (default: None).

    Returns
    -------
    mesh : Mesh
        Device mesh with axis name 'batch' for data parallelism. The mesh
        contains a linear arrangement of devices for distributing batched
        computations.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Create mesh with all available devices
    >>> mesh = create_mesh()
    >>> print(mesh.shape)
    {'batch': 4}  # If 4 devices are available

    >>> # Create mesh with specific number of devices
    >>> mesh = create_mesh(n_devices=2)
    >>> print(mesh.shape)
    {'batch': 2}

    Notes
    -----
    The returned mesh has a single axis named 'batch', making it suitable
    for distributing the first dimension of arrays across devices. For more
    complex sharding patterns, consider creating custom meshes using
    jax.sharding.Mesh directly.

    Distributes an array's first dimension (batch dimension) across devices
    in the provided mesh. This enables parallel processing of batched data
    with automatic memory distribution and computation parallelism.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : Shaped[Array, " ..."]
        Input array to shard. The first dimension is treated as the batch
        dimension and will be distributed across devices. Can be any JAX
        or NumPy array.
    mesh : Mesh
        Device mesh created by create_mesh() or custom mesh with a 'batch'
        axis. Defines how the data will be distributed across devices.

    Returns
    -------
    sharded_data : Shaped[Array, " ..."]
        Input array with the batch dimension sharded across devices in the
        mesh. The array's computation will be automatically parallelized
        across devices.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
    >>> from janssen.utils.distributed import create_mesh, shard_batch
    >>>
    >>> # Create sample data with batch dimension

    Notes
    -----
    - The batch dimension size should ideally be divisible by the number
      of devices for optimal load balancing.
    - Sharding is applied using NamedSharding with PartitionSpec('batch'),
      which partitions only the first dimension.
    - Subsequent operations on the sharded array will automatically
      maintain the sharding pattern where possible.
